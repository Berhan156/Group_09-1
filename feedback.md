## Task 2 (27/30)

### Project Charter (15/15)

#### Introduction
Really well done! Consider adding functionality for employees/managers to update stock.

#### Overview
PErfect. Try using a more decisive language in the future: "developping" instead or "going to develop" or "planning to develop"

### Technical Details (12/15)
- You can remvoe the HTML/CSS section
- Should probably consider using React or Angular for the Front-End UI. That said, React is probably a better option given that the app is using React Native.
- There are extra words at the beginning of the first sentece of developing tools (, Bootstrap, and JQuery libraries)
