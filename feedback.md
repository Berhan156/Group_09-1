## Task 2 (18/20)

### Project Charter (15/15)*2/3

#### Introduction
Really well done! Consider adding functionality for employees/managers to update stock.

#### Overview
PErfect. Try using a more decisive language in the future: "developping" instead or "going to develop" or "planning to develop"

### Technical Details (12/15)*2/3
- You can remvoe the HTML/CSS section
- Should probably consider using React or Angular for the Front-End UI. That said, React is probably a better option given that the app is using React Native.
- There are extra words at the beginning of the first sentece of developing tools (, Bootstrap, and JQuery libraries)

## Task 3

### Use Cases
- **Customers Create an Account (done by Sama)** - 10/10 - Perfect! In the future, always spell out acronyms such as OTP the first time you use them in a text.
- **Employees/Managers editing items/product inventory (done by Rupin)** - 9/10 - Well done! It is not clear what happens after step 4. Does the system loads the list of items again, or does it stay in the view showing the item that was jsut tagged as out of stock. This type of detail is important because it guides the coding. -1 I beleive this use case is for when there has been a mistake and an item was not properly updated. I would expect the system, in normal conditions, to keep track of items automatically. (no deduction)
- **Customer will create order (done by Berhan)** - 7/10 - Main flow only covers the actions from the user, not the responses from the system -2. The second alternate flow is incomplete. -1
- **Deliver Order to customer (done by Zain)** - 6/10 - Main flow only covers the actions from the user, not the responses from the system -2. I would expect the client to be able to get an update on the status of the order, as a result of the actions of the driver -1 There should be more postconditions than just a picture being taken. For example, the database will be updated. -1

### Milestones (4/5)
- Remove milestones 2, 3, and 4
- For remaining  milestones, make sure that it is clear that we are talking about designing and testing

### Deliverables (4/5)
- The proposed deliverables are not real deliverables

#### Example:
- Milestone: Design and testing of a refunding order functionality completed
- Deliverable: Refunding order functionality up and running (or pushed to production, or available to clients)
