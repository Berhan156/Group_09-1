What to do when a member misses a meeting
If a team member misses a meeting we will contact that person and see what happened and depending on the reasoning we will give them a warning if it is a reasonable   reason to miss the meeting. However, if they continue to miss the meetings many times then we will have to give the person more work as a punishment.

The undersigned members agree to work together on the project until the end of the BTS630 next Semester.  They recognize as a team and individually that they are responsible for the quality of all deliverables.
