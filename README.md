This projects will develop an online grocery shopping website. As a result, we'll have features like sign up, online payment, promotions, in store pickup, and mobile checkout. Customers will be able to purchase groceries on the website and have them delivered to their doorstep using the delivery option.

This website will be created using HTML and CSS for front end. For the back-end we will be using Node for Javascript and for the database we will be using MYSQL.
