In this project we will develop an online grocery shopping website. As a result, we'll have features like sign up, adding groceries to cart, online payment, promotions, in store pickup, and mobile checkout. Customers will be able to purchase groceries on the website and have them delivered to their doorstep using the delivery option. The project will have a different view for customers and the grocery store employees and managers.

This website will be created using HTML and CSS for front end. We also will be implementing Angular to display our application components. For the back-end we will be using Node Javascript and for the database we will be using MYSQL.
