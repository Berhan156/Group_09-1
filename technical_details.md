## Choice of front-end tool

### React native
for various platforms like iOS and Android. It is the best option for cross-platform development projects because it is cost and time-efficient, community-driven, has comprehensive libraries, and code reusability and it has great performance and a flexible framework. React native is a programming framework developed by Facebook that allows developers the ability to create full, native mobile applications for iOS and Android users by using a universal programming language called JavaScript. 
There are several benefits of React Native for mobile application development. Almost 95% or more than that the code is cross-platform which means it is compatible with both iOS and Android, developers build one app and in the end, two apps are created. It has fast performance because the programming language is optimized for mobile devices due to the advantage of the graphics processing units which makes them much faster than other technologies. The interface used in React Native makes it easy for developers to continue work where someone else left off and continue building. This makes it easy to update and upgrade mobile applications. 

### Bootstrap
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/download/) is the leading CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. This free and open-source toolkit comes with a responsive grid system, global CSS settings, extensive pre-built components including buttons, navbars, and forms, and optional JavaScript plugins to speed up the development process.
Though Bootstrap is an open-source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is often referred to as a CSS framework.


## Choice of backend tool
### Node js
Node js is an asynchronous javascript runtime that is designed to build scalable network applications. It is used for non-blocking and event-driven servers. The way people are easily able to use Node.js is of the huge number of libraries made by other people in the coding community. This would help us program our online grocery shopping website because we can use its event loop to assist the in-store pickup and checkout system. 


### Express js
Express is an application part of node js that provides features for building web and mobile applications. It can develop different types of web applications such as single page, multipage and hybrid. Express can be a good way to save a lot of coding time while making websites efficiently. Like react and angular, express also has its own routing that refers to how the application URL responds to the client request. This will help us by making sure the backend of our code will not be confusing and make it more simple for the person looking at the code.

## Choice of Database
### MYSQL
We are using MYSQL because it is open source, dependable, accessible with all significant web hosts, and simple to use. MySQL's data security and powerful transaction features are being used by many businesses to safeguard online transactions and improve consumer interactions.


## Developing Tools

This website will be developed using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with extensions such as live server, live share, react icons, and Rest client(is a postman for vs code). [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) was used to testing a number of HTTP requests in order to decouple back-end and front-end tasks.
