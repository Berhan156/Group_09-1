## Choice of front-end tool
### HTML and CSS
HTML is simple to learn and apply, and it's a valuable ability to have in our toolbox if we ever need to switch careers. HTML can assist us in creating our own unique website. We can use HTML to alter our website or create a new theme from scratch. It also enables us to design and arrange website elements such as photos, text, tables, and forms. HTML can assist you in figuring out how to make things more accessible. Screen readers may use semantic HTML tags to establish where different items are on a web page and how they're formatted, which is the foundation for excellent accessibility practices. HTML5 is the world's largest commonly used markup language, and it describes the structure, syntax, and design of content that will be displayed on a website. It instructs the browser on how we want the website's content to be displayed. It is widely utilized in the actual world for web page construction, web word processing, internet browsing, cutting-edge features, responsive photos on websites, and HTML data input support. CSS is being used to design and design web pages, such as changing the font, color, size, and space of information, splitting it into numerous columns, and adding animations and other ornamental elements. We have all of the options afforded by CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, in addition to all of the libraries, frameworks, which is why we wish to use html and css to get control.
### React native
for various platforms like iOS and Android. It is the best option for cross-platform development projects because it is cost and time-efficient, community-driven, has comprehensive libraries, and code reusability and it has great performance and a flexible framework. React native is a programming framework developed by Facebook that allows developers the ability to create full, native mobile applications for iOS and Android users by using a universal programming language called JavaScript. 
There are several benefits of React Native for mobile application development. Almost 95% or more than that the code is cross-platform which means it is compatible with both iOS and Android, developers build one app and in the end, two apps are created. It has fast performance because the programming language is optimized for mobile devices due to the advantage of the graphics processing units which makes them much faster than other technologies. The interface used in React Native makes it easy for developers to continue work where someone else left off and continue building. This makes it easy to update and upgrade mobile applications. 
### Angular
Angular is a component of the JavaScript ecosystem, which is used to create mobile and desktop web apps. When working with the latest Angular versions, however, developers don't use JavaScript; instead, they use HTML and TypeScript, a JavaScript superset. Effective Cross-Platform Development, High Application Quality, Increased Productivity and Improved, Legible and Verifiable Code, More Compact Web Services, Efficient Issue Patterns, and Excellent Design Patterns Library are just a few of the benefits.

## Choice of backend tool
### Node js
Node js is an asynchronous javascript runtime that is designed to build scalable network applications. It is used for non-blocking and event-driven servers. The way people are easily able to use Node.js is of the huge number of libraries made by other people in the coding community. This would help us program our online grocery shopping website because we can use its event loop to assist the in-store pickup and checkout system. 


### Express js
Express is an application part of node js that provides features for building web and mobile applications. It can develop different types of web applications such as single page, multipage and hybrid. Express can be a good way to save a lot of coding time while making websites efficiently. Like react and angular, express also has its own routing that refers to how the application URL responds to the client request. This will help us by making sure the backend of our code will not be confusing and make it more simple for the person looking at the code.

## Choice of Database
### MYSQL
MYSQL was my first choice because it is open source, dependable, accessible with all significant web hosts, and simple to use. MySQL's data security and powerful transaction features are being used by many businesses to safeguard online transactions and improve consumer interactions.


## Developing Tools

This website was developed using Visual Studio Code with extensions such as live server, live share, react icons, and Rest client(is a postman for vs code) . Postman was used to testing a number of HTTP requests in order to decouple back-end and front-end tasks.
