Introduction

For this project, we are creating an online grocery shopping website. On the grocery website, we will have 3 perspectives of the website. One perspective will be of the online shopper, one will be for the employee/managers. Lastly, the third perspective will be for the delivery team who delivers the groceries to the buyer's houses. From the buyer's perspective, they will be able to sign in/signup for an account, be able to add the grocery items available to the cart, have the option to checkout once they are done grocery shopping, have a paying option, and also have the option to pick up instore or get it delivered to your house. The employee/managers perspective also has the login option and the same things as the buyers however, it will be at a discounted price since they work there and they will also have a tab where they will be able to see what the customer ordered so they can pack it up for the in-store pickup or for the delivery team. From the delivery team's perspective, they can see the orders customers made so they can double-check if they are missing anything. The delivery team will also see the address so they can deliver it to the buyer.
