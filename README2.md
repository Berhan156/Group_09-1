In this project we wanted to make a website that has the real life application and we can make it better further, so we have decided to make a website for tracking couriers online. So we are going to have a feature that will allow the receiver to track his/her courier online and be able to see their ordered goods. This also allows the system to be in different domains for tracking the ordered goods.

This website will be created using HTML and CSS for front end. For the back-end we will be using Python and django framework OR Javascript and for the database we will be using MYSQL.
