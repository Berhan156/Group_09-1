We wanted to create a website for this project that would allow the application to have real-life aspects. So we've decided to create a website for tracking couriers online, complete with a function that allows the recipient to follow his or her courier online and view their requested products. This also allows the system to track the ordered products across many domains.

This website will be created using HTML and CSS for front end. For the back-end we will be using Python and django framework OR Javascript and for the database we will be using MYSQL.
