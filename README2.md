In this project we planned to make a website that will allow the application to have real life aspects in the program. So we have decided to make a website for tracking couriers online and we are going to have a feature that will allow the receiver to track his/her courier online and be able to see their ordered goods. This also allows the system to be in different domains for tracking the ordered goods. Usman

This website will be created using HTML and CSS for front end. For the back-end we will be using Python and django framework OR Javascript and for the database we will be using MYSQL.
